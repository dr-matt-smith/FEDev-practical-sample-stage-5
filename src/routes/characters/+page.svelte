                GALADRIEL
            </h3>
            <p>

                Galadriel, an Elf is a key part of the story. We meet her in the Lord of the Rings, when she
                welcomes the Fellowship to Lothlórien. In The Rings of Power, we meet a younger Galadriel who
                is a very different Galadriel: a fierce warrior who we meet on a mission to find Sauron after her
                brother died at his hands.

                During the Second Age, Khazad-dûm was the home to the dwarven kingdom, long before it falls
                into ruin. The kingdome is ruled over by King Durin III, who is supported by his son Prince Durin
                IV. We meet Durin IV burdened with the responsibility of keeping their kingdom thriving, and
                protecting it from outsiders.
